            "ROCK STAR / ( 2001 ) * * * ( out of four ) By Blake French : \" Rock Star \" is the story of a nobody who becomes propelled into fame , only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it . We have seen all this before ( in better movies ) , but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge . It garners a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere . The script , by \" Crazy / Beautiful \" director John Stockwell , portrays the hard-core universe with memorable images-it doesn 't explain what it is about , it shows us . \" Rock Star , \" originally titled \" Metal God , \" stars Mark Wahlberg as Chris \" Izzy \" Cole , a Pittsburgh office supplies salesperson who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers , the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group , Steel Dragon . Although Chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called Blood Pollution , instead of writing his own songs , he insists on performing only those by Steel Dragon , and only in the exact way they perform them . His group becomes irritated with Chris ' obsessions and gives him the boot . This devastates Chris , as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend , Emily ( Jennifer Aniston from TV 's \" Friends \" ) . He then receives a phone call . It 's the Steel Dragon band . They have seen Chris ' tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer . In an instant , Chris rockets into the dizzying world of sudden stardom-from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star . Unfortunately , it 's not as rewarding as he expected . A true story inspired the \" Rock Star \" concept . An Ohio supply salesman , Tim \" Ripper \" Owens , really did replace Rob Halford , the lead singer in Judas Priest , after initially singing for a tribute band . The rest of the film is probably fiction , although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands . The film details the various ordeals of being a rock star . It explores the aspects of touring , personality differences , the danger of drug abuse and violence , struggling relationships , sexual freedom , dishonesty , and the extreme measures of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high . I have seen all of Mark Wahlberg 's movies , and this is the first that has earned my affection . Wahlberg , a former singer / model , has made movies like \" Fear , \" \" Boogie Nights \" \" Three Kings , \" and most recently Tim Burton 's lacking remake \" Planet of the Apes . \" I am starting to admire the young actor more and more . Although he has not performed in many successful films , he has taken many chances , and done a variety of roles . \" Rock Star \" is his best film to date . I can 't think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed Chris Cole 's struggles and aspirations . Wahlberg truly makes \" Rock Star \" rock . Jennifer Aniston lights up the screen as well . She creates a chemistry-rich relationship with Chris that induces audience participation . It 's tragic of what happens to their relationship . We care about these characters a great deal . During the film concert scenes , director Stephen Herek ( who also directed \" Holy Man \" and the live action version of \" 101 Dalmatians \" ) creates a gripping atmosphere . He captures the scenes with an intense urgency , and a raw , unmistakable energy . The musical numbers provide the film with the best , most involving scenes . Unfortunately Herek cannot sustain the energy and zest throughout . At the three-quarters mark , he looses the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant . I understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame , but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it . In \" Almost Famous , \" a much better film about rock and roll , there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scenes . Here , it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion . The message comes a bit too late and suddenly in the story . The film turns into a morality tale that wants to provide us with a sappy destination . The filmmakers might as well stop everything , appear on screen and say : \" now audience , the moral of the story is \" We understand the theme , but it 's too instantaneous . The personal discovery for Chris ' must be gradual . Fortunately , all of this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the film , hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eighty-five minutes of a reasonably good feature . \" Rock Star \" is not a great movie-see \" Almost Famous \" if you want a remarkable film about rock and roll-but for Marky Mark , it 's a turning point in his career .\n",
